    The ``Etcd3Client`` class now automatically discovers available API version
    and determines the api path. It detects the appropriate api path before
    sending its first request, and the api path is reused for its subsequent
    requests. The client instance needs to be recreated, or the service using
    the instance needs to be restarted, after its backend etcd server is
    upgraded, so that the new api path is detected. The detection is skipped
    if the `api_path` argument is set when creating a class or
    the `ETCD3GW_API_PATH` environment is set.
